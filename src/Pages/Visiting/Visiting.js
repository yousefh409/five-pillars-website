        <p>
            1. When entering the gravesite, say a general salaam to the believers and recite this duaa': <br></br>
             "Peace be upon the inhabitants of this abode from among the Believers and the Muslims, and may Allah have mercy on those who have gone ahead of us, and those who come later on, and we shall, God willing, join you. (Sahih Muslim)" <br></br>
            2. Recite Qur’an with the intention of the reward going to the deceased. <br></br>
            3. Make abundant supplication for their forgiveness. <br></br>
            4. Reflect and ponder on the state of the deceased and on one’s own state. Visiting the grave is a solemn reminder of death, and reflection of such a weighty and inevitable state is important. <br></br>
        </p>
        
       <SubTitle content="Forbidden Practices"/>
        <p>As with all things, there are boundaries that we must stay within, as defined by the Shari'ah. Visiting the grave is an action that requires composure and solemnity. One should avoid excessive crying and wailing, which the Prophet ﷺ forbade.
